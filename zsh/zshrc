# APPEND_HISTORY If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to
# the history file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions
# will all have the new entries from their history lists added to the history
# file, in the order that they exit. The file will still be periodically
# re-written to trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value
# specified by $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST SAVE BY COPY option).
